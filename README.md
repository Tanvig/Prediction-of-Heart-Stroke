# Prediction-of-Heart-Stroke

## Overview
This project serves as a submission for the HSL522 course, a part of the Cognitive Science Master's program at IIT Delhi. The repository comprises:
* [Presentation](https://github.com/Tanvig/Prediction-of-Heart-Stroke/blob/main/Presentation_%20Heart%20Stroke%20Prediction.pdf)

* Code Files:<br>
[.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook)](https://github.com/Tanvig/Prediction-of-Heart-Stroke/blob/main/Prediction_of_Heart_Stroke.ipynb): The main code file with the analysis and visualization.<br>
[.py (Python Script)](https://github.com/Tanvig/Prediction-of-Heart-Stroke/blob/main/prediction_of_heart_stroke.py): An alternative version of the code in a Python script format.

* [Dataset](https://github.com/Tanvig/Prediction-of-Heart-Stroke/blob/main/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv):  The dataset used in the project.

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the risk of stroke based on various input parameters, including gender, age, medical history, and lifestyle factors. The dataset used in this analysis is a collection of patient information.

## Objectives:
* Data Exploration, Visualization and Preprocessing.

* Statistical Analysis: Conducting statistical tests to assess the significance of various factors in predicting stroke risk.

* Modeling and Evaluation: Using logistic regression model for binary classification of stroke status.

## Dataset:
The dataset is taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset  <br>
It comprises 5110 rows and 12 columns (id, gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke)

## Results:
The implemented model gave an accuracy of 74.6% with a recall for true positives (stroke as 1) as 81%.
